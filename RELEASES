V0.0.8
* rvm.trust_rvmrc task now trust the rvmrc for both the absolute release path, and the symlinked
  current path. This is needed because we use the symlink in the startup script for the app server.

V0.0.7
* Corrected rvm.trust_rvmrc hook.

V0.0.6
* Moved rvm_gemset namespace to rvm.
* Added a task to trust the application's rvmrc file, hooked after deploy:update_code.
