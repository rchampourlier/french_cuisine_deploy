V0.0.14
* Added rbenv recipe to support rbenv as a replacement for RVM. The recipe contains no task, only setup the
environment for Capistrano deployment to work seemlessly with rbenv when :using_rbenv is set.

V0.0.13
* Moved db tasks to taps.
* Creating new db tasks using dump instead of taps.

V0.0.12
* Changed db:push/pull tasks to allow working with a local PostgreSQL database. Ongoing evolution,
  expect it to be unstable.

V0.0.11
* Added maintenance:on, maintenance:off tasks that upload/delete a file to the remote server
  to display a maintenance page with a 503 response. (Similar to Heroku's)
* Many corrections (nginx virtual host file, db tasks for database syncing).

V0.0.10
* added db recipes (db:pull and db:push tasks for db synchronization using 'taps')
* added ssh recipes (open/close SSH tunnel)
* added app:change_server task performing the operations required when changing the Rails' app server

V0.0.9
* moved rvm.trust_rvmrc task to french_cuisine_bootstrap since it only have to be done once
  for all the projects deployed on a server.

V0.0.8
* rvm.trust_rvmrc task now trust the rvmrc for both the absolute release path, and the symlinked
  current path. This is needed because we use the symlink in the startup script for the app server.

V0.0.7
* Corrected rvm.trust_rvmrc hook.

V0.0.6
* Moved rvm_gemset namespace to rvm.
* Added a task to trust the application's rvmrc file, hooked after deploy:update_code.
